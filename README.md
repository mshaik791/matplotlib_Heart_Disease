Exploring the Relationship Between Cholesterol Levels and Max Heart Rate in Heart Disease Analysis

Cholesterol, a lipid present in the bloodstream, plays a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries. Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. On the other hand, max heart rate, the peak heart rate achieved during physical exertion, is an important parameter used in exercise physiology and cardiology to gauge cardiovascular fitness and establish exercise recommendations.

This analysis delves into the fascinating interplay between these two factors, cholesterol levels and max heart rate, within the context of heart disease. Using a dataset and the matplotlib library, we present a visual exploration of this correlation, seeking to shed light on potential patterns and associations.
